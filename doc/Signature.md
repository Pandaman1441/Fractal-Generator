| November 15 | 2 hours    | Phase 0 done. took about an hour reading all the instructions, and got distracted while I rewrite them so took a bit longer
| November 20 | 2 hours    | Phase 1 done. forgot I was still on phase 1 so I did the UML and User manual as well.
| November 22 | 2.5 hours  | Phase 2 done. the fractalFactory took a long time just jumping between what the .frac files looked like and how i can convert them.
| November 27 | 2 hours    | all my pseudocode is in but it still needs some touching up but i've gotta drive back to logan before it's too dark. might try to finish this phase when i get back.
| November 27 | 1 hour     | i got my default arguments to work not sure about actual arguments but things seem to be working
| November 28 | 2 hours    | Phase 3 done. all my fractals and palettes work so gonna do some testing now
| November 28 | 2 hours    | Phase 4 done. Ran the invalid.frac file a bunch and raised errors when it needed to and ran through some new unit tests that it passed.
| Total       | 13.5 hours |
